                  <p>The Golden Temple, or Harmandir Sahib, in Amritsar, Punjab, is the holiest shrine of Sikhism.
                  It was founded by Guru Ram Das in the 16th century and completed by Guru Arjan Dev.
                  The templeâ€™s upper floors are covered with pure gold, giving it its iconic name.
                  It is surrounded by the sacred Amrit Sarovar, whose waters are believed to have healing powers.
                  The architecture blends Hindu and Islamic styles, symbolizing unity and inclusiveness.
                  The temple has four entrances, representing openness to all people regardless of caste, creed, or religion.
                  The Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhs, is placed inside the sanctum.
                  A major highlight is the daily langar (community kitchen) serving free meals to thousands.
                  It is a place of deep spiritual peace, attracting devotees and tourists from across the globe.
                  The Golden Temple stands as a beacon of faith, equality, and compassion.</p>
