                  <p>The Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, is one of the most famous and ancient Hindu temples in India.
                  It is dedicated to Goddess Meenakshi (a form of Parvati) and Lord Sundareswarar (a form of Shiva).
                  The temple is renowned for its towering gopurams, adorned with thousands of brightly colored sculptures.
                  It showcases the grandeur of Dravidian architecture with intricate carvings and detailed artwork.
                  The temple complex covers 14 acres and houses numerous shrines, halls, and corridors.
                  One of its highlights is the "Ayiram Kaal Mandapam" or Hall of Thousand Pillars, known for its sculptural beauty.
                  It is a major spiritual center and a symbol of Tamil culture and heritage.
                  The temple attracts millions of pilgrims and tourists from around the world every year.
                  It is especially vibrant during the Meenakshi Tirukalyanam festival, celebrating the divine marriage of Meenakshi and Sundareswarar.
                  Beyond being a place of worship, it stands as a masterpiece of art, history, and devotion.</p>
