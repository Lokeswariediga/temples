                  <p >The Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha, is one of the four sacred Char Dham pilgrimage sites in Hinduism.
                  It is dedicated to Lord Jagannath, a form of Lord Vishnu, along with his siblings Balabhadra and Subhadra.
                  The temple is famous for its annual Rath Yatra, where the deities are taken out on grand chariots.
                   Its towering shikhara dominates the skyline of Puri and can be seen from miles away.
                   The temple follows unique rituals and traditions, distinct from other Hindu temples.
                   Non-Hindus are not allowed inside, but can view the temple from the nearby Raghunandan Library.
                   The Mahaprasad cooked here is considered sacred and is prepared in earthen pots over wood fires.
                   Its architecture showcases the grandeur of Kalinga style with intricate stone carvings.
                   The temple is a living symbol of Odishaâ€™s culture, devotion, and history.
                   Jagannath Temple continues to draw millions of pilgrims and visitors each year.</p>
