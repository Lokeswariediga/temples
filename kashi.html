                  <p>The Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, is one of the most revered Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Shiva and is among the twelve Jyotirlingas.
                  Situated on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, it holds immense spiritual significance for Hindus seeking liberation (moksha).
                  The temple was rebuilt in 1780 by Queen Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore after being destroyed multiple times in history.
                  Its golden spire and dome, plated with gold donated by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, are iconic features.
                  The main deity, Vishweshwara (Lord of the Universe), is worshipped daily by thousands of devotees.
                  The temple complex also contains smaller shrines dedicated to various gods and goddesses.
                  Pilgrims believe that a visit here, followed by a dip in the Ganga, cleanses sins and grants salvation.
                  It is a major center for Hindu rituals, including Rudrabhishek and other Vedic ceremonies.
                  Festivals like Maha Shivratri witness grand celebrations and massive crowds.
                  Kashi Vishwanath stands as a symbol of resilience, faith, and timeless devotion.</p>
